    "You work as a Data Analyst for a finance company which is closely eyeing the Android market before it launches its new app into Google Play.

    "\n",
    "Your three questions are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Part 1.</b> Read the apps.csv file and clean the Installscolumn to convert it into integer data type. Save your answer as a DataFrame apps. Going forward, you will do all your analysis on the apps DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Part 2.</b> Find the number of apps in each category, the average price, and the average rating. Save your answer as a DataFrame app_category_info. Your should rename the four columns as: Category, Number of apps, Average price, Average rating.\n",
    "\n",
